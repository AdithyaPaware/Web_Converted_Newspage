            Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Wednesday announced a ban on unauthorised drone flights over the city after
            two Ukrainian drones were alleged to have targeted Russian President Vladimir Putin. The drones, aimed at
            Kremlin in an alleged assassination bid, were shot down by Russian authorities. Sobyanin said the ban would
